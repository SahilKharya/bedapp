A dapp to Book a bed for hospitals built on ethereum using solidity and truffle

Get-a-Bed-Space is dapp built on ethereum. The problem in the current scenario is that there is a increase in number of covid positive patients but they do not have the proper information regarding availability of beds in hospitals or if there are beds available then hospitals deny these beds so as to earn profit.

By leveraging the blockchain technology, this dapp is built for the convinience of people who require to reserve or book a bed for their treatment. The dapp will have all the list of the beds available in specific hospitals and a person can book one bed at the desired hospital as per his convinience. The dapp list hospitals based on their locations and as well as private/government and the price for the bed.

When a patient books a bed, it gets reserved under the address using which the bed is booked and when patient gets healthy and frees up the bed, then the bed gets available for another booking.
